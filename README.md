# tower-csrf

This is _experimental_ middleware for tower. It provides modern CSRF protection as outlined in a [blogpost](https://words.filippo.io/csrf/) by Filippo Valsorda, discussing the research background for integrating CSRF protection in Go 1.25's `net/http`.

This repository has been discussed in [tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http/discussions/600) and the [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/discussions/3436) project respectively.

This boils down to (quoting from the blog):

1. Allow all GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS requests
2. If the Origin header matches an allow-list of trusted origins, allow the request
3. If the Sec-Fetch-Site header is present and the value is `same-origin` or `none`, allow the request, otherwise reject
4. If neither the Sec-Fetch-Site nor the Origin headers are present, allow the request
5. If the Origin headerâ€™s host (including the port) matches the Host header, allow the request, otherwise reject it

The following features from the Go stdlib [implementation](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.25.0:src/net/http/csrf.go) are not implemented:

- Custom handlers for error responses: this is not idiomatic for tower

## Open issues

- More test coverage and line-by-line comparison with the reference implementation
- Documentation
- Change the order of the logic to match the reference implementation (or documentation) exactly
